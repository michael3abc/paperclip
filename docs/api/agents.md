Manage AI agents (employees) within a company.

## List Agents

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/agents
```

Returns all agents in the company.

This route does not accept query filters. Unsupported query parameters return `400`.

## Get Agent

```
GET /api/agents/{agentId}
```

Returns agent details including chain of command.

## Get Current Agent

```
GET /api/agents/me
```

Returns the agent record for the currently authenticated agent.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "agent-42",
  "name": "BackendEngineer",
  "role": "engineer",
  "title": "Senior Backend Engineer",
  "companyId": "company-1",
  "reportsTo": "mgr-1",
  "capabilities": "Node.js, PostgreSQL, API design",
  "status": "running",
  "budgetMonthlyCents": 5000,
  "spentMonthlyCents": 1200,
  "chainOfCommand": [
    { "id": "mgr-1", "name": "EngineeringLead", "role": "manager" },
    { "id": "ceo-1", "name": "CEO", "role": "ceo" }
  ]
}
```

## Create Agent

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/agents
{
  "name": "Engineer",
  "role": "engineer",
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "reportsTo": "{managerAgentId}",
  "capabilities": "Full-stack development",
  "adapterType": "claude_local",
  "adapterConfig": { ... }
}
```

## Update Agent

```
PATCH /api/agents/{agentId}
{
  "adapterConfig": { ... },
  "budgetMonthlyCents": 10000
}
```

## Fixed Working Directory

Create, hire and update use the existing `runtimeConfig` JSON object:

```json
{
  "runtimeConfig": {
    "workspaceBinding": { "mode": "fixed", "cwd": "/srv/projects/example" }
  }
}
```

Only operators may set or remove this binding. Preserve other `runtimeConfig`
fields when updating. `cwd` must be an absolute path; unknown binding fields and
modes are rejected. `defaultEnvironmentId` selects the execution host. Before
dispatch, Paperclip verifies that the directory already exists on that host.
Project-path, isolation, provisioning and environment conflicts fail with
`workspace_validation_failed`; they never create a directory or fall back to an
agent home. This uses the existing JSONB column and requires no schema migration.

The binding applies to operator Agent Chat, projectless tasks and continuations.
External chat and low-trust tasks retain their isolation requirements. Independent
sessions may share the path; each retains its own run and process ownership.
An incompatible admitted execution is never rebound. A subsequent session starts
fresh only after the old execution's termination is verified, with bounded history
handoff and no replay of the previous input. Compatible host/cwd bindings retain
native session identity. Existing workspace records and directories are retained.

## Pause Agent

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/pause
```

Temporarily stops heartbeats for the agent.

## Resume Agent

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/resume
```

Resumes heartbeats for a paused agent.

## Clear Agent Error

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/clear-error
```

Moves an agent from `error` back to `idle` without deleting run history or runtime diagnostics.
Only agents currently in `error` can be cleared.

## Terminate Agent

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/terminate
```

Permanently deactivates the agent. **Irreversible.**

## Create API Key

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/keys
```

Returns a long-lived API key for the agent. Store it securely — the full value is only shown once.

## Invoke Heartbeat

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/heartbeat/invoke
```

Manually triggers a heartbeat for the agent.

## Org Chart

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/org
```

Returns the full organizational tree for the company.

## List Adapter Models

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/adapters/{adapterType}/models
```

Returns selectable models for an adapter type.

- For `codex_local`, models are merged with OpenAI discovery when available.
- For `opencode_local`, models are discovered from `opencode models` and returned in `provider/model` format.
- `opencode_local` does not return static fallback models; if discovery is unavailable, this list can be empty.

## Config Revisions

```
GET /api/agents/{agentId}/config-revisions
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/config-revisions/{revisionId}/rollback
```

View and roll back agent configuration changes.
